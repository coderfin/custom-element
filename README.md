## About

## Demo

[Class Based Custom Element](https://coderfin.github.io/custom-element/class)<br>
[Reflect (Class-less) Based Custom Element](https://coderfin.github.io/custom-element/reflect)<br>
[Register Element (Depricated)](https://coderfin.github.io/custom-element/register-element)

## Notes

Class based custom elements are currently the suggested way to create new custom elements.  Register element is the old way of creating custom elements and should not be used.  Reflect is an interesting way of creating custom elements without using classes.
